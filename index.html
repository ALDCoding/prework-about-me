      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Angel and I'm currently on the path to becoming a new software developer and coder.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in New York but have lived the vast majority of my life in the beautiful state of Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid computer user for mostly video games, but I'm changing that passion to a more dedicated career in the computer field.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I thought my dream job was becoming a pilot, but I'm still looking for what would be a balance between passion, interest, happiness, and a job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently reside in the state of Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe the world of computers is only going to continue to grow. I have lived playing on computers my whole life and now I build them myself. The next step for me that seems practical is to understand the software behind them and join the development world.</p>
